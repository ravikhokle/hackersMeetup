Copilot Prompts & Notes
-----------------------

This file records example prompts used with GitHub Copilot during the hackathon to make the use visible to judges.

Example prompts used:

- "Create an ES module service that fetches a repository README and returns it as text"
- "Add a small analyzer that inspects root repo contents and suggests README improvements"
- "Write a React component that posts an owner/repo string to /api/analyze and displays recommendations"

Files initially assisted by Copilot:
- `server/src/services/analyzers.js`
- `server/src/services/githubService.js`
- `client/src/components/AnalyzeForm.jsx`

We recommend keeping Copilot-assisted work on a clearly-labeled branch like `copilot/seed` and using explicit commit messages: `chore(copilot): seed <feature>`.
