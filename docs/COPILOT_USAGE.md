# GitHub Copilot Usage

This project actively used GitHub Copilot during the hackathon. To make Copilot's contributions visible:

- For key files (server analyzers and client components) we kept a developer note in `docs/copilot_notes.md` listing prompts and suggestions used.
- We include short notes in `README.md` to highlight where Copilot helped generate initial sketches.

Examples of Copilot usage:

- Generated initial implementations for: `server/src/services/analyzers.js`, `client/src/components/AnalyzeForm.jsx`.
- Suggested unit test skeletons in `server/tests/analyzers.test.js`.

During judging, reviewers can inspect commit history and PRs — Copilot-assisted commits were made from a dedicated branch `copilot/seed` and clearly labeled.
